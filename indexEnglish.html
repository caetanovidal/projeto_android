            <h2>
                The first version
            </h2>

            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (open software for vectorization of images) and create his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
            </p>

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator:
                it would be the Dandroids.
            </p>

            <h2>A new mascot emerge</h2>

            <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came Bugdroid, the new Android mascot.
            </p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk in the <strong>Google</strong>  and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>
